# sdk-rust

Rust SDK for the [Everscribe](https://everscribe.io) API. It exposes **middleware** that records an audit event per request, a **recorder** for writing append-only audit events directly, and a **minter** for issuing short-lived browser tokens for [embeddable components](https://github.com/everscribe/components).

## 📖 Setup Documentation

| Setup link | What it is | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| [Hosted AI agent](https://everscribe.io/docs/quickstart/hosted-ui) | You install our GitHub App. Our server-side agent walks your repo, proposes a plan, and opens a PR you review. | You want zero hand-wiring and are fine granting Everscribe read access to your repo. Paid feature. |
| [BYOK Claude Code skill](https://everscribe.io/docs/quickstart/skill) | Install the [`es` CLI](https://github.com/everscribe/cli) and run `es skills download setup`. That drops a skill into your Claude Code skills directory, and your own local Claude agent does the setup. Same behavior as the hosted agent, but against *your* Anthropic key, and your source never leaves your machine. | You do not want to grant Everscribe read access to your repo, and/or you want a free option and already have Claude Code. |
| [Wire it up yourself](https://everscribe.io/docs/sdks/rust-install) | Install the SDK and add the calls by hand. | You want full control, or you are instrumenting a small surface. |

## Supported frameworks
